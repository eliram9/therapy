            <p>Aging is as unique as a fingerprint; there is no set pattern or predictable formula. Each individual has a distinct path and preferences for aging.

                Your envisioned aging journey, whether for yourself or your family, might have been diverted due to uncontrollable factors, crises, or unexpected circumstances. As a result, you may find your current situation and the challenges you face to be daunting, leaving you feeling stuck or overwhelmed.

                Costs may be spiraling beyond your control and navigating through Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance may be confusing and disheartening.

                The social workers (LCSW-C, licensed certified social worker – clinical) at Generations can assist in devising a personalized plan that sets you on a path towards the utmost quality of aging. Whether you or a family member are dealing with a crisis, hospitalization, future planning, or adapting to changes, we offer tailored services that cater to your specific needs, circumstances, and vision of a successful aging process.
                Services offered: Aging consulting, crisis intervention, relocation assistance, remaining at home resources, and chronic disease and dementia education.

Aging Consultations: 

Aging consultations involve several steps to achieve optimal outcomes. 

Prior to your initial meeting, you'll receive a questionnaire to prepare for the consultation. The information you provide in the questionnaire helps identify the core issues and the focus for the consultation.

During the consultation, your social worker will dedicate time to understanding the nuances of your situation, exploring the issues you wish to address, and engage in a discussion about how we can problem solve and support.

 <hr />

Step 1: Assessment

Your social worker will take into account all relevant aspects of your life and goals of care, including quality of life, financial resources, personal desires, and safety considerations. 

This includes assessing:

Past and present medical history

Identifying functional strengths and challenges

Evaluating cognitive and mental health

Analyzing nutritional status

Conducting a home safety assessment

Reviewing physician and specialists involvement and current medical treatment plan

Considering supports and family involvement
<hr />

Step 2: Care Plan

Your social worker will develop a customized care plan using all of the assessment information. The comprehensive care plan identifies concern areas, establishes goals, suggests detailed interventions to meet those goals, and outlines the costs of options and alternatives.

The care plan is the road map to the process.

<hr />

Step 3: Education

We provide information and education to maximize your participation in decision-making and care plan implementation. Awareness of appropriate and alternative choices helps you to make the best decisions. This working partnership helps ensure your right to self-determination.


<hr />

Step 4: Implementation

Once the care plan is developed, we can work with you to coordinate the involvement of an interdisciplinary team (such as home health care agency staff, physicians, physical therapists, and facility staff). We then monitor progress and modify the care plan as necessary.

Step 5: Advocacy

<hr />

No matter where care is provided, whether hospital emergency rooms, rehabilitation facilities, doctors’ offices, nursing homes, or home care, advocacy is critical. Meeting you and your families’ goals requires ongoing coordination of the interdisciplinary team and attention to the needs and desires of your aging care plan.
